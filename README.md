Cinema Ticket Automation is a ticket management system developed using C# and integrated with an SQL database. The application features a seat selection panel, a pictureBox for displaying movie posters, and groupBoxes for ticket sales and cancellation. When users select a movie name and theater number, the corresponding movie poster is automatically displayed, and the film date and session details are updated accordingly. Additionally, the session listing page allows for filtering by date. The system supports management functions such as ticket sales, ticket cancellation, adding theaters, adding/removing movies, and adding/listing sessions.
